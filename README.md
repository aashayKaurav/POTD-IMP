## Description

The Problem of the Day (POTD) is a popular platform that offers daily programming challenges to improve problem-solving skills. This repository aims to provide a consolidated resource of significant questions along with their solutions from the POTD of plateforms such as GFG and Leetcode.

The questions are categorized based on their topics, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, etc. Each question includes a brief description, a link to the original problem, and a solution implemented in a specific programming language.

## List of Topics

- **Arrays**

- **Linked Lists**

- **Trees**

- **[Dynamic Programming]**(Dynamic Programming)


## Solutions

For each question, a solution is provided in a specific programming language. The solutions are implemented in a clear and concise manner to demonstrate the approach and logic used to solve the problem. Each solution includes comments for better understanding.

The solutions are organized within the same directory structure as the questions, making it easy to navigate and locate the corresponding solution for a specific question.
